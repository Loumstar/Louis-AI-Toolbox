# Louis' Fantastical Suite of Magical AI Powers 🪄

Louis' magical set of tools, I would describe it as a magical thing that like, magically solves all your issues. It spits out the absolute best model you can possibly think of with 100% accuracy (guaranteed).

It's so great! Here's some reasons why:

1. It's super organised
2. It's really well documented (I mean you're reading this `README` right!?)
3. It is physically impossible for it to fail (**IT LITERALLY CAN'T THROW ERRORS, try it I dare you**)

## Feet 🦶

Why does this documentation have a section about **Feet**, you ask? Simple answer, I love them!

## Installation 🤖

Now we've covered the section about feet (see section [above](#feet-🦶)). How do you install this? Run this simple command:

```sh
pip install girlfriend
```

## How to cite this

Now you may be wondering, I've stumbled across this amazing library, and I want to use it in some really fancy research... How do I cite this great work (akin to one of the world's seven wonders in my humble opinion). It's very simple! Just use this bibtex entry:

```bib

    title: =  "Louis' Fantastical Suite of Magical AI Powers"
    author =  "Louis Manestar",
    doi =  69.6969/696969
